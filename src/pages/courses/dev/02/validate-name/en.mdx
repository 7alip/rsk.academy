In this lesson you will interact with another smart contract already published on the network: `Master Name`.

## Validate the Name project

Now you have your smart contract Name deployed on RSK Testnet.

In order to pass to the next lesson, you must submit your project to Academy.

The MasterName is the judge! 

So fill your name and the address of your smart contract Name, and click in 
`Set name`.

<br/>
<MasterName />
<br/>

If your did some mistake, it is possible to `delete` the project already submited, 
create a new smart contract Name and submit it again.

## Important

You cannot sign up for someone else :)

And how are we going to verify this?

The transaction must be sent from the same address as the publication of your smart contract `Name`

In other words, when registering, we are associating your address with your name.

## Porfolio

After your `Name` smart contract was validated by the Master Name smart contract,
it will appear in your `portfolio`.

The `portfolio` shows all your projects submited and validated during this course.

Go to your [Portfolio](/portfolio) 
and check your project `Name`.


## Congratulations!

You finish the second lesson.

In the next lesson you will learn about ...
