## Requirements

1. Selected the RSK network selected the web wallet, Nifty or Metamask.
2. Have tR-BTC in your wallet.
3. On Remix, at `Deploy and run transactions`, under `Environment`, make sure you have selected the `Injected Web3` option.

First of all, be sure that you selected the RSK network selected the web wallet, Nifty or Metamask...

Ensure that you have tR-BTC in your wallet,
as this is needed to pay gas fees when deploying the smart contracts.
To do so, please follow the instructions related to: [RSK faucet](/courses/dev/01/rsk-faucet).

Don't forget to select the `Injected Web3` option in `Environment`, located at `Deploy and run transactions` on Remix.

## Deploy a smart contract on RSK testnet

In Remix, on the left side, locate the fourth button: `Deploy and run transactions`.

For now we have only one smart contract, so it is automatically selected in the dropdown list.

Click the button `Deploy`.

![Deploy and run transactions](../../images/frontend-web3-injected/image-05.png)

It will open a popup window on the web wallet,
to confirm the transaction set up by Remix to publish the smart contract.

Click confirm.

At bottom right, we can check the message: `creation of Name pending...`

Once it is confirmed, we can check it:

Click on the transaction line or the symbol next to the `Debug` button (at the right side), to see more details of the transaction:

![transaction details](/images/image-27.png)

Copy the transaction hash to verify it on the blockchain explorer

In this example, the transaction hash is:

`0x419c4b17ec0bf59568d9b5f5c7f0e4678039f52b9c644c2914ccd0bd2bb331da`

## RSK Explorer

The RSK explorer is the blockchain explorer for RSK transactions.
We will use the Testnet explorer:

[explorer.testnet.rsk.co](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

![explorer](../../images/remix-and-metamask-with-rsk-testnet/image-30.png)

Past the transaction hash at search field, at the top of the screen

![search](../../images/remix-and-metamask-with-rsk-testnet/image-31.png)

![search transaction](../../images/remix-and-metamask-with-rsk-testnet/image-32.png)

This is the result:

![transaction result](../../images/remix-and-metamask-with-rsk-testnet/image-33.png)

You can verify my example at: [`0x419c4b17ec0bf59568d9b5f5c7f0e4678039f52b9c644c2914ccd0bd2bb331da`](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/tx/0x419c4b17ec0bf59568d9b5f5c7f0e4678039f52b9c644c2914ccd0bd2bb331da)

## Interact with the smart contract

When a smart contract is deployed with Remix, we can see it in the left panel under deploy and run transactions.

Click on the copy button at the right side of the smart contract to copy the address of the smart contract. We will need it for use later.

> UPDATE

![smart contract address](../../images/frontend-web3-injected/image-07.png)

In my example, the contract address is `0xc864D0fef177A69aFa8E302A1b90e450910A4c3E`.
