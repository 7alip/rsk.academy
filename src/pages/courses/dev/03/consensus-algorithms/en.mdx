## Smart contracts in Ethereum

The first Blockchain that started its network in January 2009,
the Bitcoin, defined by Satoshi Nakamoto,
was not prepared for the implementation of smart contracts.

Enter Vitalik Buterin,
who realized that a Blockchain could go far beyond cryptocurrency transfers,
then creating Ethereum.

Vitalik saw Blockchain as a decentralized global computer,
an environment where smart contracts could be executed.
