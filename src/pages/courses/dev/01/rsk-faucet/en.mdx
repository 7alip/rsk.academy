## Testnet

A testnet is a network with the same characteristics as the main network of a blockchain,
but their crypto and tokens aren't worth real money.

## RSK faucet tR-BTCs

The Smart Bitcoin (R-BTC) is the token used to pay for the execution of transactions in RSK.
In the faucet you can get it for the RSK Testnet.

## Get some testnet R-BTCs at faucet

You can get some Testnet R-BTC at
[faucet.testnet.rsk.co](https://faucet.testnet.rsk.co/).

Copy the address from your wallet

Enter your wallet address and pass the CAPTCHA.

For example, I will get some tR-BTCs for this address:
