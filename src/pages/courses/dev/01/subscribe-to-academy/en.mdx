In this lesson you will interact with another smart contract already published on the network: **RSK Academy**

When you sign up,
RSK Academy will create a smart contract called portfolio,
to record all the projects you do during the course.

In the RSK Academy smart contract itself, there will also be a monitor of your performance,
when doing multiple choice tests and projects.

> The course is managed by smart contracts, independently!

## Connection x registration: what is the difference?

Just connecting your wallet to RSK Academy is not your application.

The registration is carried out with your wallet, that is,
you first need to connect, then sign up.

The process of enrollment registers your wallet in the RSK Academy smart contract.

After signing up, you can follow your evolution on the [profile](/profile) page.

Once you're signed up,
when you connect your wallet to RSK Academy,
your student profile will automatically be loaded.

## Do the application for **RSK Academy**

To apply for RSK Academy,
you will submit a transaction by executing a function in the RSK Academy smart contract.

To subscribe, click on the **Subscribe** button

> TODO
> Component to subscribe

Your web wallet will open a popup window to confirm the transaction.

Click on confirm / submit.

## Registration confirmed

In the same way that you tracked the transaction to transfer cryptocurrencies,
you can check the enrollment transaction at RSK Academy.

For example, here's the transaction confirmed at Nifty

![Nifty subscription confirmed](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-02.png)

And by clicking on the transaction, 
you can see it in the [explorer](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

Take a look on my application:

[XXX](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/tx/XXX)

## Profile

After your subscription transaction is confirmed,
you can see your profile.

Go to your [Profile](/profile) 
and check your student's information.

For example, here is my application:

## Congratulations!

You are already enrolled in the course!
