## Crypto wallets

> TODO

To have cryptos, we need tR-BTC and an address to store them.

The best way is to create a wallet from a mnemonic, using the pattern defined at [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

There are a few ways to do this.

One is to create using a web wallet,
such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
or [Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet) wallet.
These wallets generate the mnemonic for you.

## Mnemonic

> TODO

Copy these 12 words, we'll use it later.

### iancoleman.io/bip39

This web app:

[iancoleman.io/bip39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)

is very useful for understanding mnemonics and derived keys.

On the other hand, it is not so safe to generate a mnemonic and private keys on a website.

## Code test

```js ln={8-10} viewlines
var abi = UPDATE_ABI_HERE

var Bytecode = UPDATE_BYTECODE_HERE

var Contract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
var instance = Contract.new(
  {
    from: web3.eth.accounts[0],
    data: '0x' + Bytecode.object,
    gas: '4700000',
  },
  function (e, contract) {
    if (typeof contract.address !== 'undefined') {
      console.log(
        'Contract mined! address: ' +
          contract.address +
          ' transactionHash: ' +
          contract.transactionHash,
      )
    }
  },
)
```

## Code test 2

```js
const x = [12, 'a', { a: 3 }]
```
