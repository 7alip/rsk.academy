## Crypto wallets

> TODO

To have cryptos, we need tR-BTC and an address to store them.

The best way is to create a wallet from a mnemonic, using the pattern defined at [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

There are a few ways to do this.

One is to create using a web wallet,
such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
or [Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet) wallet.
These wallets generate the mnemonic for you.

## Mnemonic

> TODO

Copy these 12 words, we'll use it later.

### iancoleman.io/bip39

This web app:

[iancoleman.io/bip39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)

is very useful for understanding mnemonics and derived keys.

On the other hand, it is not so safe to generate a mnemonic and private keys on a website.
