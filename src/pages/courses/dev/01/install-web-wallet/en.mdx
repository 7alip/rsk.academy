To have cryptocurrencies, we need an address / wallet to store them.

There are a few ways to generate an address,
we will do this from a mnemonic in a wallet.

Here are some web wallets:

- [Metamask] (https://metamask.io/)
- [Nifty] (https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet).

These wallets generate the mnemonic for you.

In our course we will use Nifty wallet.

## Nifty Wallet

Nifty wallet is a kind of web wallet that facilitates transactions with your accounts.

It can also be used with RSK networks because it is already configured for this.
It is a Chrome extension.

[Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet) wallet 
was developed by POA network, which is an Ethereum sidechain.
At another point in this course we will talk about sidechains.
