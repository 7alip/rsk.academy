Before go deeply in some crypto wallet concepts, it will present a little review.

> In short, a crypto wallet is a tool that you can use to interact with a blockchain network.

Contrary to popular belief, crypto wallets don't truly store cryptocurrencies. 

Instead, they provide the tools to send and receive cryptocurrency via blockchain transactions.
Among other things, 
they manage one or more pairs of public and private keys.


## More about mnemonics

Essentially, a seed phrase or mnemonic,
works like a root key that generates and gives access to all keys and addresses in a crypto wallet. 

A mnemonic is generated from the pattern defined in
[BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

- BIP = Bitcoin Improvement Proposal

### iancoleman.io/bip39

This web app:

[iancoleman.io/bip39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)

is very useful for understanding mnemonics and derived keys.

I recommend to do some tests.

On the other hand, it's not so safe to generate a mnemonic and private keys on a website,
so do NOT store real cryptos in addresses generated from here.

## Derivation Path, or dPath

If you use a mnemonic phrase or hardware wallet, 
you may come across the term "derivation path." 

The same mnemonic can generate addresses for different blockchains using the dPath.
So each coin has its own base derivation path, to ensure that you get different addresses for each coin.

In short, it specifies which is the way will be generated the private key from this wallet.
The address comes from public keys which also are generated using the derivation path.

A derivation path looks something like this:

```
m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
```

Note the extra "/0" at the end of the derivation path. 
This number is called the address index, 
and is used by wallets to show you different address from the same source

Take a look on some dPaths:

| Blockchain  | dPath               |
| :---------- | :-----------------: |
| Bitcoin     | m/44'/0'/0'/0       |
| Ethereum    | m/44'/60'/0'/0/0    |
| RSK Mainnet | m/44'/137'/0'/0/0   |
| RSK Testnet | m/44'/37310'/0'/0/0 |

The mnemonic generates "master"s public and private keys, 
and using the address index it is created many addresses from same base.

There are some specifications for this:
- [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
- [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)

For example, for this mnemonic:

```
shoot gate legend member sniff asthma smart slot famous call marriage math
```

Take a look on the different addresses, generated from the mnemonic above:

| Blockchain  | Address                                    |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------: |
| Bitcoin     | 1DgNhyMRzko5rJ5qZ91ZvGkw1B91kpJp2j         |
| Ethereum    | 0x0eDbe1BbdA93b333640E1E32866C474ca2Fb5756 |
| RSK Mainnet | 0x1aB23F5e15CfAE441F43e3a9b1FD9767C054432e |
| RSK Testnet | 0xa63375173fFA44725b5CDe4dCfdE7D6Ccf5FFFaa |

You can try it on [iancoleman.io/bip39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

## Ethereum and RSK Accounts

RSK is compatible with Ethereum address and dPath, but, in fact, it has your own dPaths.

Another difference about Ethereum and RSK is that on Ethereum, the addresses from Mainnet and all Testnets are the same.
RSK uses different dPaths for Mainnet and Testnet. 
This avoid you to wrongly uses funds from a testnet blockchain in another thats the money is "real".

This it a great flexibility, but also can create some confusing between wallets.

RSK recognizes Ethereum addresses, and in some cases, 
like when you are using a token bridge, which the funds will be sent from one blockchain to another, 
they will be sent to the same address.
So you need to use the Ethereum dPath on this case.

## Checksum

Another point that can create confusion in addresses in different wallets is the checksum concept.

The checksum is the use of the chainID on the process of generate a address.

Again, some wallets use it, others no, and the address can looks different, but in fact they are all the same.

If you have problems with wallets saying that the address in invalid, 
try to convert the address to lowercase. 
This will works in most part of the cases.

## Metamask vs Nifty wallet

Nifty wallet nativally has the cofigurations for RSK networks 
so the addresses generated by Nifty follows the dPaths:

In the other side, in Metamask you can add custom networks and in this way, add the RSK networks.
But Metamask, until now, only uses the Ethereum dPath.
So you will have a address generated for RSK Blockchain, 
which you can send and receive funds and transactions normally, 
but other wallets can tell you that this address is NOT valid in RSK network, but it is!

You also can configure a custom network in Nifty addind the RSK networks, but using Ethereum dPaths. 
This is a great funcionallity from Nifty!

> TODO same mnemonic, different addresses

## Account vs UTXO

We are talking about wallets
Important concepts about blockchains Bitcoin and RSK / Ethereum is the way they manage the balance of an address.

This is the difference between Account vs UTXO

RSK and Ethereum uses the account concept, it means that it has a screenshot of all accounts in the last block, 
and the balance of an address is the value stored over there.

On the other hand, Bitcoin uses the UTXO concept, that is, UTXO

It manages the

## Wallets groups: software, hardware and paper

THe crypto wallets can be classified in three groups: software, hardware, and paper wallets. 

### Software wallet
The majority of crypto wallet providers are based on software.  

It can also be also classified in desktop, mobile and web wallets.
- Desktop: a software which is installed in your computer, 
so, you download and execute locally on your computer. 
- Mobile: an software, knowing by app, which is installed in your smartphone.
These are quite convenient as they allow you to send and receive cryptocurrencies through the use of QR codes. 
- Web: here we have two types:
  - browser extension: instaled in your browser.
  - web site, accessed through a browser interface without having to download or install anything.

Some service providers hold and manage the private keys on your behalf. 
Although this may be more convenient for inexperienced users, it's a dangerous practice! 
If you don't hold your private keys, you're trusting your money to someone else. 

There are a popular prhase related to this:

> Not your keys, not your cryptos!

### Hardware wallet

Hardware wallets are physical, electronic devices to store your keys, generate addresses and create transactions.

Some of them uses a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys. 
The keys are then stored in the device itself, which isn't connected to the Internet. 

Others can be connected on internet only during the time that you are creating and sending a transaction.

The software wallets are more convenient than hardware wallets. 
However, hardware wallets tend to be the most secure alternative. 

You should consider using a hardware wallet 
if you plan to hold your cryptocurrency for a long time 
or if you're holding large amounts of them. 

### Paper Wallet

A paper wallet consists of a "wallet" printed out on a piece of paper.

So, it is a piece of paper on which a crypto address and 
its private key are physically printed out in the form of QR codes. 
These codes can then be scanned to execute cryptocurrency transactions.

It is good to understand the concepts of public and private key, 
they have a great use in events to teach the these first concepts, 
but their use is now deemed as obsolete and unreliable.


## Wallet types: hot or cold
Hot vs. cold wallets

Depending on their working mechanisms, they may also be referred to as hot or cold wallets.

### Hot wallet
A hot wallet is any wallet that is connected all time to the Internet. 

For example, when you create an account on a exchange and send funds to your wallets, 
you are depositing into exchange's hot wallet. These wallets are quite easy to set up, and the funds are quickly accessible, making them convenient for traders and other frequent users.


Most part of software wallets are hot wallets, connected to the Internet. 


### Cold wallet
Cold wallets, on the other hand, have no connection to the Internet. 
Instead, they use a physical medium to store the keys offline, 
making them resistant to online hacking attempts. 

Hardware storage is a type of cold wallet and it is one of the most secure alternatives.

SO, cold wallets are safer alternative of "storing" your coins.
This method is used by long-term investors or "HODLers."

## Multisig wallet

In a short, a multisig wallet is a wallet which needs more than one signature (or approval)
in order to send a transaction, it means, transfer cryptos.

Some service providers offers shared control of wallets, 
they can know one key, you and other persons can know other keys
and it must have more than one key to send a transaction.

It's important to check the technical approach of each wallet before choosing the most suitable for you.

> Both of them are web browser extensions, 
> they stored your keys locally, in your computer.

## The importance of backups

If you loose the access in your wallet and you don`t have any backup,
You probally lost your cryptocurrency forever!

It's important to back up them regularly. 
In many cases, this is achieved by simply backing up wallet.dat files or seed phrases. 

Also, if you opted for password encryption, remember to back up your password as well.

> It is very important that you have a backup of your mnemonic / seed prhase!

## Closing thoughts

Crypto wallets are an integral part of using cryptocurrencies. 

Now you know important concepts related to wallets!

They are one of the basic pieces of infrastructure that make it possible to send and receive funds through blockchain networks. 

Each wallet type has its advantages and disadvantages, 
so it's important to understand how they work before moving your funds.

The next step is to take a test to be sure you have learned everything.

The result of your test will be recorded on your course registration.

In the next module you will learn about smart contracts :)
