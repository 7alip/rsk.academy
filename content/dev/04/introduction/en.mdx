## Solidity programing language

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

It is a [curly-bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Curly-bracket_languages)
language, which means that the characters **{** and **}** defines statement blocks.

Solidity is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

## Final considerations

The purpose of this lesson was to talk a bit about Solidity history and concepts.

In the next lesson you will learn the Solidity programing language.
